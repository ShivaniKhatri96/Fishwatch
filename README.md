# fishwatchv2

> I am redoing this assignment for myself just to practice these type of questions in this branch for future reference because I couldn't complete all the assignments during 2hr30min time interval. Main branch is the one I did for the take-home assignment.

## Tools used

- React, sass, React-select library, and the [fishwatch api](https://www.fishwatch.gov/developers)

### first assignment completed

- grid layout containing various fish
- It works on all screen types: I used flexbox for it
- Made some changes in this version

### second assignment completed

- search bar that filters various fish based on their species name

### third assignment completed

- A select / dropdown to filter species based on harvest type (Wild, Farmed, or any)
- filters also search bar and select requirement

### Currently working on 
- select styles 

### Next
- making searchbar and select responsive
- assignment four
  Clicking on an individual tile should reveal some more information about the species. You are free to select the way this extra information is shown (e.g. modal, other "page", ..).
