# fishwatchv2

> I am redoing this assignment for myself just to practice these type of questions in this branch for future reference because I couldn't complete all the assignments during 2hr30min time interval. Main branch is the one I did for the take-home assignment.

## Tools used

- React, Typescript, Sass, React-select library, and the [fishwatch api](https://www.fishwatch.gov/developers)
- I used Sass because it give me the freedom to make my code reusable using mixins and at the same time I can show my css skills 
- I used React-select library for select/dropdown to show that I am capable of working  with libraries as well

## Responsive design
- Both Home page and Article page has responsive layout and works on all screen types
- I used Media queries, flexbox and grid to obtain the result

### first assignment completed

- grid layout containing various fish
- It works on all screen types: I used flexbox for it
- Made some changes in this version

### second assignment completed

- search bar that filters various fish based on their species name

### third assignment completed

- A select / dropdown to filter species based on harvest type (Wild, Farmed, or any)
- filters also search bar && select condition
- React-select styles changed
- making searchbar and select responsive

### Assignment four completed

- assignment four (modified): Clicking on the button shows more information about the species. The extra information is shown in another page
- making fish article page responsive

### Final Note
- This assignment is complete. Not being able to do all 4 assignments during 2hr30min crushed my soul. I redid this assignment to prove to myself that I am capable of finishing this exercise. I am glad I did it again because it helped me restore my confidence. Off to Farm World project now!
